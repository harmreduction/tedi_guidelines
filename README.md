# Expanded TEDI guidelines for data collection and sharing

This repository contains, for now, a single JSON file with the proposed expansion template of the [TEDI Guidelines](https://www.tedinetwork.org/guidelines/) for DATA collection provided by the [TEDI Network](https://www.tedinetwork.org/).

The Mexican project (Programa de An√°lisis de sustancias - **PAS**) is working together with [Deliberar](https://deliberar.org/) towards building an Early Alert System with the government (**Observatorio nacional de Drogas**). The OEA has invited representatives from Deliberar to be their advisors for the development of the observatory. 


**PAS** project provides a perfect framework to develop an open source, and standardized toolset for any organization offering Drug-Checking services.
The toolset will enable an organization to be ready to collect data and will provide them with an easy way to share their data with a Global Early Warning System (i.e. TEDI, [EMCDA](https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/)). 


The general proposal includes:

- Making the TEDI guidelines [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) compliant.

  - Defining data types of each field (Variables) 
  - Defining requirement levels for the fields
  - Defining a `vocabulary_set` data type for specific fields

- Defining a **Minimal Standard** based on the current guidelines with the core information suggested for a Drug-Checking service to be able to start working  
- Defining Standard Expansions that are context-dependent 

*Work in progress*
