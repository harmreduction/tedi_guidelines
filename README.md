# TEDI guidelines expansion for data collection and sharing

This repository contains a YAML file with a proposed expansion schema of the [TEDI Guidelines](https://www.tedinetwork.org/guidelines/) for Drug Checking Data collection. 

The Mexican project (Programa de An√°lisis de sustancias - **PAS**) is working together with the NGO [Deliberar](https://deliberar.org/) towards building an Early Alert System with the government (**Observatorio Nacional de Drogas**). The OEA has invited representatives from Deliberar to be their advisors for the development of the observatory. 

**PAS** project provides a suitable framework to develop an open source and standardized toolset for any organization offering Drug-Checking services.
The toolset will enable an organization to be ready to collect data and will provide them with an easy way to share their data with a Global Early Warning System (i.e. TEDI, [EMCDA](https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/)). 



## The general proposal includes:

1. Making the TEDI guidelines [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) compliant by defining:

    -  Data annotation protocols with queriable universal unique identifiers UUIDs (**F**indability)
    -  Data access, sharability, and anonymization protocols (**A**ccessability)
    -  Requirement levels for the fields (**I**nteroperability)
    -  Data types of each field (Variables) (**R**eusability)
    -  A `vocabulary_set` data type for specific fields (I, R)

2. Defining a **TEDI Minimal Standard**.
 
 Based on the current version of the TEDI guidelines, the FAIR-compliant minimal standard will provide an organization with the core information needed for a Drug-Checking service to be able to start working and set up their tools for data collection and sharing.
 
3. Defining Standard's Expansions TEDI-**Xp** that are context-specific:
  
    - Testing method Xps. Expansion for the data collection according to the performed testing method 
    - Type of service Xps. Expansion for the data collection according to the type of service (consumption room, festival setting, street outreach)
